# burger

## About
This was created late May / Early June 2018. 

## Technologies 
This app was built with the model view controller design pattern. Using Node, Express, body-parser, and handlebars. It's also using mysql to establish a connection with the database. 

## How it works
In this burger-eating app the page will load and display two different sections of burgers from our database; one section of burgers that have been eaten already and one section of burgers that are cooked and ready to be eaten. 
Each burger will have a button next to it so that you can eat those already cooked or you can hide the burgers that have already been eaten and spare yourself the shame of gluttony. 
A user can also type into the form at the bottom and 'cook' any type of burger they want simply by clicking the submit button.
